Network engineer working for over 20 years in Enterprise IT, mostly in networking.

### More Information

I've seen many attempts by companies over the years to produce a product that does 'Network Automation' but they all fail to deliver on their promise. At some point the solution within the product is to "just use an expect script here", which then always relied on screenscraping etc.

With the advent of Dev-Ops (and probably cloud) there was suddenly talk of APIs for network devices and lots of open source tooling options available. This is what I had been waiting for.

So I dived head first into Ansible and Python and although I have no recent coding/development experience I'm going to share what I learn as there are lots of other engineers in my place too.

I hope you find my articles useful...
